# Fun with Webpack


## Summary/Motivation

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

I've been constantly using "create-react-app" for most of my React coding life, but I always wanted to learn how to set up a React project with Webpack and Babel from scratch! For fun and curiosity's sake (and to setup my next learning topic) I also added in TypeScript. 

## Structure

Each directory is a different "project" (e.g. containing its own Webpack configuration, dev server and Babel configuration).

This project is not intended to be a boilerplate, but rather a learning tool for setting up Webpack, Babel and TypeScript projects from scratch.

1. Vanilla JavaScript
2. Vanilla TypeScript
3. React (with class properties Babel plugin)
4. React and TypeScript

## Starting the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into the sub-project you wish to explore and run `yarn install`
3. To start the sub-project and run `yarn run start:dev`


## Todo

- [] Code Splitting
- [] Lazy Loading
